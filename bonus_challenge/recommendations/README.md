Welcome to my submission of the Bonus Expooratory Problem for the SalesLoft Analyst offline exercise. Necessary instructions to run the .ipynb file for Jupyter notebook for my Recommendations analysis are provided here below. 

## Bonus Exploratory Problem

The bonus challenge is to analyze the bookings data and provide recommendations to SalesLoft's sales process to improve the Close Rate.  

- Definition: Close Rate = Number of opportunities closed won / Number of opportunities

### Instructions

- Hereâ€™s a last 12 month denormalized data set on SalesLoft's Bookings [CSV file](/bonus_challenge/data/Bookings_Data.csv).

- My Recommendations were uploaded as a Google .Docx document with my analysis done on a Jupyter Notebook environment.  My documents were placed in the [recommendations directory](/bonus_challenge/recommendations) along with the necessary instructions to run the files.

## Running the 'Bookings Data Analysis.ipynb' Notebook
